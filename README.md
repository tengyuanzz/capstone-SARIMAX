# SARIMAX Experiments

## The SARIMAX model experiments that are ran:
* **SARIMAX Vanilla:** The baseline SARIMAX model using standard input features (OHLCV).
* **SARIMAX-TI:** SARIMAX enhanced with features derived from technical indicators.
* **SARIMAX-S:** SARIMAX enhanced with features derived from sentiment analysis.
* **SARIMAX-TI-S:** SARIMAX combining both technical indicator and sentiment analysis features.

Installation Instructions:

1. **Create Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Replace 'my_env' with your preferred environment name
    conda create --name my_env python=3.11 -y
    ```

2. **Activate Conda Environment:**
    Before installing packages, activate the environment you just created:

    ```bash
    conda activate my_env
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now show the environment name in parentheses (e.g., `(my_env) your_user@your_machine:...$`), indicating that it's active.

3. **Install Required Packages:**
    Ensure you are in the main directory of this project (where the `requirements.txt` file is located) and your Conda environment is active. Run the following command to install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command uses `pip` (Python's package installer) within the Conda environment to install the dependencies.

4. **Running the code:**
    To run the code, simply go to the Jupyter Notebook (install extension if on VS Code) and click on "Run All" on the notebook of choice. Make sure to activate the corresponding environment.
